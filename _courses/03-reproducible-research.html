description: Document all the choices you make about data collection and analysis, in a way that can help future readers of your research.
---
<p>Journals require that you share your code and data in a replication package at the end of your research project. Following some best practices from day 1 can not only help you prepare this package later, but also make you a more productive researcher. In this workshop, we start with an empty folder, and finish with a mini-project about public procurement across various European countries. Together we discuss and document all the choices we make about data collection and analysis, in a way that can help future readers of our research.</p>
