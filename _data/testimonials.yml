  review: "It was very interesting and useful. The atmosphere were very supportive and friendly. No punishments for mistakes, just hacks how to work with them. It was ideal to learn coding for the first time without pressure and worries about grades. I also liked that instructor helped us with solutions and gave advice. [...] It was the best cource I took at CEU."
